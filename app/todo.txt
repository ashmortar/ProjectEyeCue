-- new todos
standardize text size

TODO
----------------------------------

// maybe instead of touchable opacity we use touchable without feedback and "pop" in the modals?

~!~ all things server ~!~

regarding the bar at the bottom being slide-able : what if it was always 
at the bottom, but you slid it up to reveal all the options.. like move,
pounce, sniff, listen, echo, etc.  But also change zoom, exit game, etc. 
When it was "small" (size it is now) it would have just basic info like now,
but when swipe up it would have the controls? /shrug
