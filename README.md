## Description

This is a cross platform mobile game developed in React Native by Aaron Ross and Natalia Telpkhova over the course of 7 weeks for an internship at EyeCue Lab in PDX.
As a player you take the role of either John, an exorcist who has been possessed by the evil he was trying to destroy, or Levi, his apprentice who
survived things going wrong but lost his vision.  You navigate around the board trying to locate Shrines that are the source of the evil's power and either
desecrate them or bless them, depending upon your role.  You can play online with other people or play with 2 people on 1 device!
